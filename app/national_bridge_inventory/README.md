# National Bridge Inventory

This app is used to process the *csv* files available in the **National Bridge Inventory** database.

## Reading Data

### Bridge Selection

The user can specify a set of bridge item values to select from the data.
All computations by the app will only consider the set of bridges selected by the user.

## Simulation

This app allows for simulation of bridge condition rating change over time.
The app allows parameters for the simulation to be specified by the user.

### Transition Matrix

The transition matrix is generated based on the rules specified by the user.
The user can set the following properties:

### Monotonically Decreasing

If this setting is set to *True*, the transition matrix will not include any transitions to a higher condition rating.

### Bridges

If the user specifies a set of bridges, only that set of bridges will be considered when computing the transition
matrix.

### Markov Chain

The markov chain is computed by raising the transition matrix to the power of the iteration and multiplying by the state
vector.
s<sub>1</sub> = T<sup>i</sup>s<sub>0</sub>

### Monte Carlo

The monte carlo sampling technique is used to sample from the distributions generated by the markov chain.

### Latin Hypercube

The latin hypercube sampling technique stratifies the distribution before sampling.
