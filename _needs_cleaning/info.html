            OpenStreetMap® is open data, licensed under the Open Data Commons Open Database License(ODbL) by the
            OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF).<br/>
            You are free to copy, distribute, transmit and adapt our data, as long as you credit OpenStreetMap and its
            contributors. If you alter
            or build upon our data, you may distribute the result only under the same licence.<br/>
            The full legal code explains your rights and responsibilities.
            The cartography in our map tiles, and our documentation, are licensed under the Creative Commons
            Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 license (CC BY-SA).
            How to credit OpenStreetMap<br/></p>
        <p>
            We require that you use the credit “© OpenStreetMap contributors”.<br/>
            You must also make it clear that the data is available under the Open Database License, and if using our map
            tiles, that the cartography is licensed as CC BY-SA.
            You may do this by linking to this copyright page.<br/>
            Alternatively, and as a requirement if you are distributing OSM in a data form, you can name and link
            directly to the license(s).
            In media where links are not possible (e.g. printed works), we suggest you direct your readers to
            openstreetmap.org
            (perhaps by expanding 'OpenStreetMap' to this full address), to <a href="opendatacommons.org">opendatacommons.org</a>,
            and if relevant, to <a href="creativecommons.org">creativecommons.org.</a></p>
        <p>
            For a browsable electronic map, the credit should appear in the corner of the map. For example:</p>

        <h2>PSF LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR PYTHON 3.6.4rc1</h2>
        <p>
            1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation ("PSF"), and
            the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and otherwise using Python
            3.6.4rc1 software in source or binary form and its associated documentation.</p>
        <p>
            2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby
            grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to reproduce,
            analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative works,
            distribute, and otherwise use Python 3.6.4rc1 alone or in any derivative
            version, provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of
            copyright, i.e., "Copyright © 2001-2017 Python Software Foundation; All Rights
            Reserved" are retained in Python 3.6.4rc1 alone or in any derivative version
            prepared by Licensee.</p>
        <p>
            3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
            incorporates Python 3.6.4rc1 or any part thereof, and wants to make the
            derivative work available to others as provided herein, then Licensee hereby
            agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of the changes made to Python
            3.6.4rc1.</p>
        <p>
            4. PSF is making Python 3.6.4rc1 available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis.
            PSF MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BY WAY OF
            EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, PSF MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR
            WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE
            USE OF PYTHON 3.6.4rc1 WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.</p>
        <p>
            5. PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON 3.6.4rc1
            FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
            MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON 3.6.4rc1, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
            THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.</p>
        <p>
            6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material breach of
            its terms and conditions.</p>
        <p>
            7. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship
            of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and Licensee. This License
            Agreement does not grant permission to use PSF trademarks or trade name in a
            trademark sense to endorse or promote products or services of Licensee, or any
            third party.</p>
        <p>
            8. By copying, installing or otherwise using Python 3.6.4rc1, Licensee agrees

            is also called the “Linked Version”.<br/></blockquote>
        <blockquote>The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding
            Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work
            that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br/>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code
            and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed
            for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries
            of the Combined Work.

            2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br/>
        <blockquote>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers
            to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an
            argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
            version:<br/></blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote> a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
                ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility
                still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful,
                or
            </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <blockquote> b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this

            3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br/>
        <blockquote>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file
            that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided
            that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts
            and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you
            do both of the following:
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote> a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
                Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote> b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license

        <p>
            4. Combined Works.<br/>
        <blockquote>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,
            effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work
            and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:<br/>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote> a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used
                in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote> b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote> c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the
                copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to
                the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote> d) Do one of the following:</blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote>o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the
                Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
                recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
                modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
                Corresponding Source.
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote>o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable
                mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's
                computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
                interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote> e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to
                provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information
                is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or
                relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the
                Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
                Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
                section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

            5. Combined Libraries.<br/>
        <blockquote>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single
            library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
            License,
            and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:<br/>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote> a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
                uncombined
                with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote> b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the
                Library,
                and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br/>
        <blockquote>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General
            Public
            License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
            differ in detail
            to address new problems or concerns.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies
            that a
            certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
            have the
            option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version
            published by
            the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
            Lesser
            General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published
            by the Free
            Software Foundation.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the
            GNU Lesser
            General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
            authorization
            for you to choose that version for the Library.
